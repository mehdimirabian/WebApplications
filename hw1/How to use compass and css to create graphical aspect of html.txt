To work with compass you need to run compass in your web application directory in web2py using the following command: compass run static
then using this you can then in your pycharm navigate to ...\<application_name>\static\sass
then in there you can create constants for colors or fonts or watever in the file _constants.scss
and you can use these constants to create classes in the myapp.scss which do a lot of different things such as
graphical shapes and fonts and all of that.
this scss file will create an actual css file which then can be used in our html file called myapp.css in the directory:
...\web2py\applications\<application_name>\static\css
REMEMBER this works only if compass is running and also its advantage is using variables for colors and fonts and stuff

now if you want to forget about compass and want to just create a css file then you need to create a css then in the layout.html
you need to declare that css file.
then you can use all the awesome features in your main html file for example:
the following is in page.css:

.myquote {font-family: 'Consolas', 'Deja Vu Sans Mono', 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', monospace;}

.mid_content {background: #00d95a;
            color: #0000cc;}


and the following is page.html which uses that css (note the names do not need to match):
<div class="mid_content">
    <p>First paragraph.</p>
    <p>Second paragraph.</p>
    <p>I love <span class="myquote">to feed my cats.</span></p>
    <p>I never bake <span class="myquote boldquote">cakes.</span></p>
    <a href="www.soe.ucsc.edu">School of Engineering</a>
</div>

like you can see the following has the background with color #00d95a and font color #0000cc and also at some point
uses the font monospace, specifically where it says "to feed my cats".

note that if we used compass we would be able to set the colors to a variable to use it in many places and
in case of a change wed only change one thing
