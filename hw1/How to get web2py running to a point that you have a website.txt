First note:
first look at the image called "things you need to create a website"
note web2py that you download is an open source BUT start application that he refers to get from git
is not and is created by him, so you can use it as an example but create your own application like i 
mention in the bottom

You download web2py. 
make a folder in your applications folder
create a python file in it named file.py
create a function in that file name function
and also create a html file in it named function.html(same name as the function)
note that html file will show the things function has created 
then when you run your python file in pycharm or when you put in command "python web2py -e" you can start your website server on port 8000 or anything higher than that
then your website url is "<ip_address>:<port_number>/<application_name>/<file_name>/<function_name>
